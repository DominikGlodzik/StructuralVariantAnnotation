\title{StructuralVariantAnnotation: a package for SV annotation}
\description{
StructuralVariantAnnotation contains useful helper functions for reading
and interpreting structural variants calls. The packages contains functions
for parsing VCFs from a number of popular caller as well as functions for
dealing with breakpoints involving two separate genomic loci. The package
supports encoding breakpoints as `GRanges` objects and BEDPE-formatted
data frame.
}
\details{
* Parse VCF objects with the `breakpointRanges()` function.
   * Find breakpoint overlaps with the `findBreakpointOverlaps()`
  and `countBreakpointOverlaps()` functions.
   * Generate BEDPE files for circos plot with `breakpointgr2bedpe()` function.
   * ...
